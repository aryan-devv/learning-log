### 🧠 How Japanese Engineers Learn on the Job
In Japan, learning is often:
- **Observation-first** (watch seniors carefully)
- Asking fewer questions, but **very precise ones**
- Improving silently through repetition and correction

This explains why:
- Fundamentals are valued more than flashy skills
- Juniors are expected to grow steadily, not instantly

This matches perfectly with:
- DSA basics
- Daily repetition
- Long-term consistency
