## 💻 Software Development

### 🧠 DSA Foundations — Day 1
- Officially started **DSA basics**
- Shifted mindset from:
  - “Just solving problems”
  → **Understanding patterns, constraints, and efficiency**
- Focused on:
  - What makes a problem *DSA-style*

## 🌏 Japan × Career Learning

### 🧠 Why Japanese Engineers Value Fundamentals
In Japan, engineers are expected to:
- Master **basics deeply** before advancing
- Avoid shortcuts and flashy solutions
- Build trust through **consistent, correct fundamentals**

This directly aligns with:
- Starting DSA from the ground up
- Writing fewer but more reliable solutions
- Long-term growth over quick wins
