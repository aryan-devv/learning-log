# 🚀 Day 29 — Learning Log 📘🇯🇵  
📅 Date: Day 29  
🔥 Current Streak: 29 days  
🏆 Longest Streak: 29 days

## 💻 Software Development

### 🧠 DSA Practice — Matrix Rotation (C)

- Implemented **90° clockwise matrix rotation** using DSA logic
- Used **transpose + row reversal** approach
- Focused on:
  - Index mapping
  - In-place modification
  - Avoiding extra space
- Added clear step-by-step logic in code

📌 Key Concepts Applied:
- 2D arrays as data structures
- Nested loop control
- Pattern recognition in matrices

⏱️ Time Complexity: **O(n²)**  
📦 Space Complexity: **O(1)** (in-place)

## 🇯🇵 Japanese Language — Kanji Revision

- Revised **9 Kanji** today
- Focused on:
  - Meaning recall
  - Reading confidence
  - Usage awareness
- Detailed Kanji breakdown shared separately on Discord

---

## 🎧 Japanese Listening
- Listening practice completed
- Focused on:
  - Natural sentence flow
  - Recognition of familiar Kanji-based words
  - Overall comprehension without translating word-by-word

---

## 🌏 Japan × Career Learning

### 🧠 Problem-Solving Culture in Japan
Japanese engineers are trained to:
- Break problems into **clear steps**
- Prefer **simple, reliable solutions** over clever tricks
- Explain logic before writing code

This matches DSA thinking:
→ clarity > speed  
→ structure > shortcuts  

---

## 🧠 Reflection
Day 29 required **slow, deliberate thinking**.

- Didn’t rush the solution
- Understood *why* transpose + reverse works
- DSA mindset is settling in
- Consistency is now automatic

Thinking first. Coding second.

---

## 📌 Next Up (Day 30)
- More matrix / array DSA patterns
- Strengthen complexity intuition
- Kanji revision + listening
- Maintain streak 🔥
