## 🌏 Japan × Career Learning

- Learned why **self-verification** is highly valued in Japanese workplaces
- Engineers are expected to:
  - Test their own work
  - Re-run and validate logic before submission
  - Take responsibility for correctness
- Accuracy and accountability build trust faster than speed

Today’s software practice matched this mindset perfectly.
