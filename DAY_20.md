## 🌏 Japan × Career Learning

### 🧠 Thinking Before Coding (Japanese Engineering Mindset)
Japanese engineers strongly value:
- Planning logic before writing code
- Manual dry-runs and reasoning
- Minimizing rework through clear thinking

This aligns directly with:
- DSA-style problem solving
- Algorithm-first mindset
- Writing fewer but higher-quality lines of code

---

## 🧠 Reflection
Day 20 marked a **shift in mindset**.

- Coding felt more intentional
- Logic came before syntax
- Japanese study stayed consistent
- Progress felt calm, not rushed

Thinking like an engineer > typing fast.

## 📌 Next Up (Day 21)
- More DSA-oriented problems
- Continued Kanji revision
- Listening + consistency
