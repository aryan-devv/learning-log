## 🇯🇵 Japanese Language — Kanji Revision

Revised **5 Kanji** today with focus on meanings, readings, and recall.

- **休** — rest, take a break, sleep  
- **通** — pass through, commute  
- **年** — year, counter for years  
- **入** — enter, insert  
- **明** — bright, light, clear  

Focused on long-term retention rather than speed.
