**Why Japanese companies value generalists early in careers**

Japanese companies often train engineers as **generalists first**, rotating them across teams to build system-level understanding before specialization.

- GitHub reflects real, compounding effort
- Mindset shifting from “learning” to “building”

Consistency is officially a habit now 🔥
