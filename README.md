- Progress in **software development**
- Japanese language learning (Kanji, listening, output)
- Japan × career insights
- Reflections and direction for the next week

📂 Format:  
`WEEK_1.md`, `WEEK_2.md`, `WEEK_3.md`, …

## 🔁 Consistency Philosophy
🔥 Progress is built by **showing up regularly**, not by chasing motivation.  
📈 Small effort, repeated daily, compounds into real skill.
