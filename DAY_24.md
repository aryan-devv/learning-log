## 🌏 Japan × Culture Learning

### 🧠 先輩・後輩 (Senpai–Kohai) System
- Seniority is based on **experience**, not age
- Respectful attitude comes before skill
- Juniors observe, listen, and learn first
- Politeness builds trust faster than raw talent

Key idea:
> 「実力より、姿勢が先に見られる」  
> *Before skills, attitude is judged.*

## 🧠 Reflection
Another steady day.

Consistency is doing the heavy lifting now.
